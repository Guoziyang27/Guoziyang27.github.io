However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent's reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression.","tags":["IEEE VIS"],"title":"TacticFlow: Visual Analytics of Ever-Changing Tactics in Racket Sports","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616803200,"objectID":"08900c4610b8c05ba45acd36efa6acb5","permalink":"https://guoziyang27.github.io/project/va-system-vis21/","publishdate":"2021-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/va-system-vis21/","section":"project","summary":"Visual anlytics system for IEEEVIS 2021.","tags":["Visualization"],"title":"TacticFlow","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jiang Wu","Ziyang Guo","Zuobin Wang","Qingyang Xu","Yingcai Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603584e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603584e3,"objectID":"fa09e4c39ba332d7da55f935642e2bcc","permalink":"https://guoziyang27.github.io/publication/vis2020/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vis2020/","section":"publication","summary":"By detecting and analyzing the multivariate subsequences that frequently occur in the rallies (namely, tactical patterns), athletes can gain insights into the playing styles adopted by their opponents, and therefore help them identify systematic weaknesses of the opponents and develop counter strategies in matches.
