I am an undergraduate student at Zhejiang Univeristy, studying [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/). Currently, I am working as a research intern at [ZJU IDG](https://zjuidg.org/) and [CMU DIG](https://dig.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/) and [Prof. Adam Perer](https://perer.org/).

My research focuses on leveraging visualization and data mining to combine machine computing power and human cognition and convert overwhelming information into knowledge.

Specifically, my research aims to reveal insights in event sequence data and use visualization to help interpret AI.
